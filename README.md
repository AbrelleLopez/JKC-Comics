# JKC-Comics

## Theme
JKC Comics (Japanese, Korean, Chinese Comics)
## Description
A personal website to store all the comics that have been read by the creator who very much likes reading, obviously.
- Used HTML and CSS in VScode
- With the help of canva for UI designing, google for allocating resources, chatgpt for
asking ‘how to’s, and one local resource–my picture.

## Utilization of the creator
To store the comics that they have read and personally input their review about it. 
With an option to favorite or unfavorite it (but SMD).
(Disclaimer: this is only around 3.4% of what I have read, these are just samples)

## How to Run
